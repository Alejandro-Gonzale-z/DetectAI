# Detect AI 

## Game Objective 
For our 485 Project, we decided to create an informative game. Participants will be shown pieces of content and they must detect whether it is AI generated or human created. We will provide some context for where the content may appear, for example for a piece of text content we will inform the users that this may be an excerpt from a news article. The game will include two distinct rounds.
- Round 1 (Benchmark)
  - Players make uninformed guesses on whether content is AI generated or human created.
  - Players will receive no educational feedback after their guesses, only the correct answer will be displayed in the "feedback bubble".
- Round 2 (Improvement)
  - Players will continue to guess under similar conditions.
  - After each guess they will receive specific educational feedback detailing what characteristics and clues they should have looked for to make an informed guess.

## Purpose
The primary goal is education through gamification. We hope to immerse particiapnts in our interactive game, we aim to:
- Highlight common patterns in AI generated vs human created content.
- Equip players with practical techniques for identifying AI content.
- Measure and encourage improvement through our structured learning process.

## Educational Features
- Informational Interlude:
  - We will show key techniques on how to identify AI, text, image, and voice content.
  - The content is meant to be concise, engaging and practical.
- Feedback in Round 2:
  - Each guess is round 2 is followed by feedback that dissects the content.
  - This feedback is meant to show how the techniques listed in the informational interlude can be applied to direct examples.
